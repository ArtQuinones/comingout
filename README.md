# Coming Out
I made this website as a way to come out to my friends and family. 
This is the first website I've coded and I'm excited to share it with y'all.
* All the writing is mine. 
* The images are a combination of my own and family photos.
## Acknowledgements
* Bootstrap was used in the making of this website.
* The format of the writing is based loosely on the Nancy podcast #48: Five Simple Steps.
